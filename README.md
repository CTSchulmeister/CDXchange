# CDXchange

CDXchange is the project I created for my Networked Based Applications course in college.  It is a simple express app that allows users to swap CDs with one another.

## Scripts

(From within the public directory.)

`npm run resetDb`
This scripts reset the mock database.

`node app`
Start the application.
